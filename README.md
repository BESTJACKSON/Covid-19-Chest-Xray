# Process Covid19 Patient chest Xray by using simple CNN moedel and ResNet algorithms
Test for the covid chest Xray
I processed the covid patient chest Xrays by using resNet algorithm. 
All details are recorded in the docx file. 
As for the ResNet model, I create an interface to show the final result. I only collect the open source for the model part. 
As For the CNN model, I predict a simple result but not correct. I follow an open resource to create this file. I attach the link below.

Thanks for Mdalmas.
